The corrected code replaces the invalid class name with a valid one.  Ensure your Tailwind configuration includes this class.

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 bg-blue-500 text-xl">
</div>
```

Or, if you intend to use a custom class, make sure it is defined in your Tailwind configuration. For example, adding `@layer components { .my-custom-class { ... } }` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.
