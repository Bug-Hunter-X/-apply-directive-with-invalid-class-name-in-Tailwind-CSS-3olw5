This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or has a typo.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 @apply bg-blue-500 text-xl">
</div>
```

If `bg-blue-500` is not a valid Tailwind class, this will cause an error, and in some cases, may not show any visual errors at all.  You may see unexpected styling or no styling changes.
